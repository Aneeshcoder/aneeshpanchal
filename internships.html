      <h2>Research Internships</h2>
      <h3>Department of Applied Mathematics, DTU, Delhi, IN (May 2022 - June 2024)</h3>
      <p><strong>Supervisor: Dr. Vivek K. Aggarwal, Associate Professor</strong></p>
      <p>Worked on formulating and simulating a predator-prey-scavenger model with Holling's Type III functional response, estimating parameters using physics-informed deep neural network from American Forest Dataset, fine-tuning model parameters through BFGS algorithm, and testing stability with Jacobian analysis.</p>
      <p>Adaptive equidistributed moving meshes using Entropy-based strategy implemented using Deep Neural Networks for Convection Dominated Problems.</p>
      <p>Equidistributed moving Mesh Using Entropy-based Monitor function for Convection-Dominated Problems - Details will be updated soon.</p>
      <h3>Department of Mathematics, IIT Delhi, Delhi, IN (June 2023 - July 2023)</h3>
      <p><strong>Supervisor: Prof. Mani Mehra, Professor</strong></p>
      <p>Worked on 1-dimensional Singularly Perturbed Convection Diffusion Problem for finding optimal adaptive mesh for Numerical solution of Boundary Layer Problems in fluid dynamics. Developed non-uniform mesh minimizing error and maintaining smoothness answering critical questions about mesh points and position of layer formation.</p>
      <h3>Computational Analytics and Learning Intelligence Based Research Exploration (CALIBRE), DTU, Delhi, IN (Sept 2022 - Apr 2024)</h3>
      <p><strong>Supervisor: Prof. Rahul Katarya, Professor</strong></p>
      <p>Developed KANHA - Kinetically Adaptive Neurodevelopmental-disorder Highway Assistant. Real-time road safety technology for neurodevelopmental patients providing personalized route suggestion using facial expression and surrounding analysis.</p>
      <p>Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection using Nature Inspired Algorithms from 3D Video Dataset. Compared nature-inspired algorithms for feature selection with high accuracy and feature reduction.</p>
